# Zomato API 

For this project, we are using the Zomato API. Zomato APIs give you access to the freshest and most exhaustive information for over 1.5 million restaurants across 10,000 cities globally.

We are making calls to Zomato API and requesting information as per the requirement of the Problem statements. 

## Motivation for using Zomato API

By Collecting the data using Zomato API one can recommend restaurants on the basis of user’s affinity to specific cuisines, establishment types, locations, and price bands.
We can find out whether restaurant support online reservation or not. We can find what is the most popular and/ or exclusive/new at a given location & time.
